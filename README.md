# ESP-32-Capacitive_touch_controller

Spoiler...this isn't an actual functional game with a touch controller.

ESP32-Capacative_touch_test.ino is a script that enable two pins on the Adafruit ESP-32-S2 TFT Feather for touch sensing as well as lighting up the red LED.

ESP32-touch-sensor-4way.ino is a script that prints the words UP - DOWN - LEFT - RIGHT on the TFT when designated pins are touched. This is a test for a future game controller. 

ESP32-Donkey_Kong.ino is not a game but some graphics with sprites that move...a little...I made some changes. Original code for this .ino was found https://www.brettb.com/coding-tutorials/arduino-tft-display-game-sprites/!
